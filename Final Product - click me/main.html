      <h1>Our Idea</h1>
      <p>We created a questionaire-type page to gather information about the user, and
        using a dataset about young people from Kaggle.com, we utilized machine learning
        to calculate a mental health score and give you feedback in the form of a website page.
        With 8 different categories, they all come together to detect points in your life
        that may need some assistance. For example, a user might reply "Drinking Often" to
        a question about alcohol, and a model will compare your response to other datapoints,
        then giving you advice and feedback on a potential category like loneliness. </p>

    <section id="method">
      <h1>Our Methods</h1>
      <p>We utilized a series of K-Nearest Neighbor models to map the similarity between
        test subjects and the user to score them with the values that was most mathematically
        similar to them. The models came from the Scikit Learn library in Python. We then pushed
        each value into an array and printed different messages based on the scores for
        each category. We used Websockets to transfer the data from a backend Python server
        to use for the website. Our frontend was built with HTML and CSS, as well as JavaScript for
        the calculations and button functionality.
